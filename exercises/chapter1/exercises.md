# Chapter One Exercises

## Exercise 1
To familiarize yourself with GraphQL and writing GraphQL queries, explore the public movies GraphQL API at [`https://movies.neo4j-graphql.com`](). Open the URL in a web browser to access GraphQL Playground and explore the `DOCS` and `SCHEMA` tab to view the type definitions. 

Try writing queries to answer the following questions:

  * Find the titles of the first 10 movies, ordered by title.
  * Who acted in the movie "Jurassic Park"?
  * What are the genres of "Jurassic Park"? What other movies are in those genres?
  * What movie has the highest `imdbRating`?

## Exercise 2

Consider the business reviews application we described earlier in the chapter. See if you can create the GraphQL type definitions necessary for this application.

## Exercise 3

Download Neo4j and familiarize yourself with Neo4j Desktop and Neo4j Browser. Work through a Neo4j Sandbox example dataset guide at `neo4j.com/sandbox`
